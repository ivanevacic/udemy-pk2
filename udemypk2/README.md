The Challenge:
Using the starter template (https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-pk2) you will have to build a website that uses IBM Watson Speech to Text API (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/). What is it going to do? That is up to you! But using this API you can do things like: Use words "UP" "DOWN" to control the website scrolling using a bit of javascript. Or you can display what the user says on the website. Here is a tutorial video to get you started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imb4RSG6alg

Looks difficult? Don't worry, being a developer is all about making small steps towards the end goal. Along the way, you will learn about Voice Recognition and working with APIs. Most importantly you will have another project to put into your portfolio to wow your clients.

Don't have a microphone on your computer? Partner up with a programming buddy who has one!

The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn about Voice Recognition (which will be very important in the future).
